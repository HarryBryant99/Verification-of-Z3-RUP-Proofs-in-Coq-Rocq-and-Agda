  the Agda code used in the short article Harry Bryant, Andrew Lawrence, Monika Seisenberger, and Anton Setzer: Verifying Z3 RUP proofs with the interactive theorem provers Coq/Rocq and Agda which appeared in the abstracts of [Types 2025](https://msp.cis.strath.ac.uk/types2025/)
- In

  an example of a railway with Z3 code for verificatoin
- In

  a checker for Z3 proofs of propositional formulas
- In
  [link](Rocq/) a RUP checker. This extends the preliminary code used in the Types 2025 paper together with an extracted checker for formulas in CNF and a checker which checks proofs with propositional formulae, and uses in case of Rup the extracted Rup checker.
